    <h1>Mini-Challenge: Portfolio Website</h1>
    <p>This is designed to serve as a tool for demonstrating expertise, creativity, and suitability for employment or advancement opportunities.</p>
    <p>Here we are going to mention a few uses of portfolio</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diversification: One of the primary functions of a portfolio in investment terms is to spread risk across different assets. By diversifying investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities, investors aim to reduce the impact of any one investment's poor performance on the overall portfolio.</li>
        <li>Risk Management: A portfolio helps investors manage risk by balancing high-risk, high-reward investments with lower-risk assets. This strategy can be tailored to an individual's risk tolerance and investment goals.</li>
        <li>Income Generation: For many investors, especially those nearing or in retirement, portfolios can serve as a source of income. Dividends from stocks, interest from bonds, and rental income from real estate holdings can provide a steady stream of income.</li>
        <li>Long-Term Wealth Building: A portfolio is often viewed as a vehicle for long-term wealth accumulation. By consistently investing over time and allowing investments to grow, investors can harness the power of compounding to build significant wealth over the years.</li>
        <li>Benchmarking and Performance Measurement: Portfolios serve as a tool for benchmarking and evaluating investment performance. By comparing portfolio returns against relevant benchmarks, investors can assess how well their investments are performing relative to the market or their investment objectives.</li>
    </ul>
